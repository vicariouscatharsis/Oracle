# CodexExp

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.2.7.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Deploying to Vercel

This repo is configured for Vercel with [vercel.json](/d:/Vs%20Codex/codex-exp/vercel.json).

### Option 1: Import from Git

1. Push this project to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
2. In Vercel, choose `Add New...` -> `Project`.
3. Import the repository.
4. Vercel should detect Angular automatically. If it asks, select the `Angular` framework preset.
5. Deploy.

### Option 2: Deploy with the CLI

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

For production:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

### Notes

- This app is frontend-only, so anything exposed in browser code is public.
- The GIF feature depends on a client-side GIPHY API key flow. If you later move that key out of the source code, you will need a server-side proxy or Vercel Function to keep it private.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
